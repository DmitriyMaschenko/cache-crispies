==============

Speedy Rails JSON serialization with built-in caching.

Why?
----

There are a lot of Rails serializers out there, but there seem to be very few these days that are well maintained and performant. The ones that are, tend to lock you into a specific standard for how to format your JSON responses. And the idea of introducing breaking API changes across the board to a mature Rails app is daunting, to say the least.

In additon, incorporating a caching layer (for performance reasons) into your serializers can be difficult unless you do it at a Rails view layer. And the serialization gems that work at the view layer tend to be slow in comparison to others. So it tends to be a one step forward one step back sort of solution.

In light of all that, this gem was built with these goals in mind:
1. Be fast
2. Support caching in as simple a way as we can
3. Support rollout without causing breaking API changes
4. Avoid the bloat that can lead to slowness and maintenance difficulties

Requirements
------------
- Ruby 2.4â€“2.6 _(others will likely work but are untested)_
- Rails 5 or 6 _(others may work but are untested)_
- Redis (for caching)

Features
--------
- **Fast** even without caching _(benchmarks and comparisons coming soon)_
- **Flexible** lets you serialize data any way you want it
- **Built-in Caching** _(documentation coming soon)_
- **ETags** for easy HTTP caching
- **Simlpe, Readable DSL**

Configuration
-------------
### ETags
```ruby
CacheCrispies.configure do |conf|
  conf.etags = true
end
```
_`etags` is set to `false` by default._

### Custom Cache Store
```ruby
CacheCrispies.configure do |conf|
  conf.cache_store = ActiveSupport::Cache::DalliStore.new('localhost')
end
```
`cache_store` must be set to something that quacks like a [ActiveSupport::Cache::Store](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Cache/Store.html).

_`cache_store` is set to `Rails.cache` by default, or `ActiveSupport::Cache::NullStore.new` if `Rails.cache` is `nil`._

Usage
-----
### A simple serializer
```ruby
class CerealSerializer < CacheCrispies::Base
  serialize :name, :brand
end
```

### A not-so-simple serializer
```ruby
  class CerealSerializer < CacheCrispies::Base
    serialize :uid, from: :id, to: String
    serialize :name, :company
    merge :itself, with: MarketingBsSerializer

    nest_in :about do
      nest_in :nutritional_information do
        serialize :calories
        serialize :ingredients, with: IngredientSerializer
      end
    end

    show_if ->(_model, options) { options[:be_trendy] } do
      nest_in :health do
        serialize :organic

        show_if ->(model) { model.organic } do
          serialize :certification
        end
      end
    end

    def certification
      'Totally Not A Scam Certifiers Inc'
    end
  end
```

Put serializer files in `app/serializers/`. For instance this file should be at `app/serializers/cache_serializer.rb`.

### In your Rails controller
```ruby
class CerealsController
  include CacheCrispies::Controller

  def index
    cereals = Cereal.all
    cache_render CerealSerializer, cereals, custom_option: true
  end
end
```

### Anywhere else
```ruby
CerealSerializer.new(Cereal.first, be_trendy: true).as_json
```

### Output
```json
{
  "uid": "42",
  "name": "Eyeholes",
  "company": "Needful Things",
  "tagline": "Part of a balanced breakfast",
  "small_print": "This doesn't mean jack-squat",
  "about": {
    "nutritional_information": {
      "calories": 1000,
      "ingredients": [
        {
          "name": "Sugar"
        },
        {
          "name": "Other Kind of Sugar"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "health": {
    "organic": false
  }
}
```

How To...
---------
### Use a different JSON key
```ruby
serialize :is_organic, from: :organic?
```

### Nest another serializer
```ruby
serialize :incredients, with: IngredientSerializer
```

### Merge attributes from another serializer
```ruby
merge :legal_info, with: LegalInfoSerializer
```

### Coerce to another data type
```ruby
serialize :id, to: String
```
Supported data type arguments are
- `String`
- `Integer`
- `Float`
- `BigDecimal`
- `Array`
- `Hash`
- `:bool`, `:boolean`, `TrueClass`, or `FalseClass`

### Nest attributes
```ruby
nest_in :health_info do
  serialize :non_gmo
end
```
_You can nest `nest_in` blocks as deeply as you want._

### Conditionally render attributes
```ruby
show_if (model, options) => { model.low_carb? || options[:trendy] } do
  serialize :keto_certified
end
```
_You can nest `show_if` blocks as deeply as you want._

### Render custom values
```ruby
serialize :fine_print

def fine_print
  model.fine_print || options[:fine_print] || '*Contents may contain lots and lots of sugar'
end
```

### Include other data
```ruby
class CerealSerializer < CacheCrispies::Base
  serialize :page

  def page
    options[:page]
  end
end

CerealSerializer.new(cereal, page: 42).as_json
# or
cache_render CerealSerializer, cereal, page: 42
```

### Set custom JSON keys
```ruby
class CerealSerializer < CacheCrispies::Base
  def self.key
    :breakfast_cereal
  end

  def self.collection_key
    :breakfast_cereals
  end
end
```
_Note that `collection_key` is the plural of `key` by default._

### Force rendering as a collection or not
By default Cache Crispies will look at whether or not the object you're serializing responds to `#each` in order to determine whether to render it as a collection, where every item in the `Enumerable` object is individually passed to the serializer and returned as an `Array`. Or as a non-collection where the single object is serialized and returned.

But you can override this default behavior by passing `collection: true` or `collection: false` to the `cache_render` method.

This can be useful for things like wrappers around collections that contain metadata about the collection.

```ruby
class CerealListSerializer < CacheCrispies::Base
  nest_in :meta do
    serialize :length
  end

  serialize :cereals, from: :itself, with: CerealSerializer
end

cache_render CerealSerializer, cereals, collection: false
```

### Render a serializer to a `Hash`
```ruby
CerealSerializer.new(Cereal.first, trendy: true).as_json
```


_**NOTE:** Documentation for caching is coming soon._
